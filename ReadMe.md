These files include code I used to visualize
  - flow cytometry data of immune phneotyping panels for tumor infiltrating immune cells
  - counts of samples used per tumor entity
  - success rates of tumor samples grown in organoid cultures

The code may be used for others' projects and are free of copyright.
File references in the code have to be adjusted to the local file management
 as well as names for gates within the flow cytometry panel visualization.
